### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Eran.

I'm a developer looking to solve real problems with programming, contribute to others with my knowledge and never stop learning.

I mostly develop in C++, Python and Java but can work with any language. I like to work with unix/linux and develop for that platforms as they serve me everyday.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying how to work with AWS in my next projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning django
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that can make impact for other people or anything intresting.
